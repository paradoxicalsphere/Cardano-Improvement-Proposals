## Executive Summary<a name="summary"></a>

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have been heralded as the future of governance, unlocking a more egalitarian approach to decision making. Historically, DAOs rely on token-weighted governance, in which users with the most tokens have the biggest share of voting power. Unfortunately, token-weighted governance models can inadvertently end up handing over control to a few "wealthy" participants, stripping influence away from the many. The current proposal offers a solution approach for implementing a DAO within an existing organization or workplace, leveraging the structures and strengths already established to ensure that the DAO remains incorruptible.
