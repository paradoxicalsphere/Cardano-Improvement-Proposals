## Executive Summary<a name="summary"></a>

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) DAOs offer a model for decision making that distributes voting rights across all members. Whereas members in a labor union elect a centralized leadership, for example, there is usually no central authority in a DAO—only the will of the collective. DAOs have been heralded as the future of governance, unlocking a more egalitarian approach to decision making. Historically, DAOs rely on token-weighted governance, in which users with the most tokens have the biggest share of voting power. Unfortunately, token-weighted governance models can inadvertently end up handing over control to a few participants holding the majority of tokens, stripping influence away from the many.<sup><a href="#SashaIvanov">1</a></sup>

The current proposal offers a solution approach for implementing a DAO within an existing organization or workplace, leveraging the structures and strengths already established, to ensure that the DAO remains incorruptible over time.

Establishing a DAO may help prepare and position an existing organization or workplace to survive and thrive in a future where Web3 solutions help solve problems of cooperation and collaboration at scales previously not possible. Organizations and workplaces establishing DAOs may be more adaptable, resilient and vibrant in response to changing social and market conditions, becoming more productive and competitive. Establishing a DAO may also help an organization or workplace continue to attract the best talent in the next generations of workers.

The proposal aims to describe solution components—such as new processes and software applications—as well as methodologies to establish a DAO successfully in an existing organization or workplace.

## Inputs and Outputs<a name="io"></a>

Determining the solution approach relies on the following inputs:

- Business need
- Organizational process assets
- Required capabilities

Use the solution approach to define the solution scope.

## Assumptions and Constraints<a name="assumptions"></a>



Successful DAOs build cooperation.<sup><a href="#Veritasium">2</a></sup> Working to build—or rebuild—trust requires good, positive and ongoing communication reinforcing truthfulness, integrity and reliability, and comes with no guarantee of success.<sup><a href="#SterzikTrust">3</a></sup>

## Solution Components<a name="components"></a>



### New Processes<a name="components"></a>

In the current proposal, the membership of a DAO established in an organization or workplace is comprised of employees. Depending on the business needs, existing organizational processes and required capabilities, a DAO established in an organization or workplace collectively takes responsibility for some decision making that would otherwise be made by individual employees, smaller teams, management or union leadership.

The DAO architecture introduces a new decision-making apparatus that provides opportunities to select and move people into positions of success, power and influence on the basis of demonstrated abilities and merit as a form of motivation.

In an organization or workplace operating a DAO, 


 based on meritocracy

<!-- START HERE Discuss KPIs -->

Responsibilities of the DAO align with KPIs

Management and union leadership, if applicable, are empowered to revise the operating rules of the DAO in circumstances when the DAO begins to fail, noting that the goal of a DAO is building cooperation.

Customers may benefit from improved organizational responsiveness and engagement that DAOs may facilitate.



<!-- Maybe a DAO within the workplace is a new form of union -->

When designing a DAO, the solution approach informs the solution scope.

<!-- Perhaps as a starting point for determining solution scope, consider pain points within the organization, including decision making processes that are painful or ineffectual within the organization. -->

### Software Applications<a name="software"></a>

In a DAO, decision-making power typically is associated with one or more tokens created on a blockchain. Tokens represent a form of resource allocation. A blockchain is a digital ledger used to track token resource allocation immutably.

<!-- Discuss subnet and smart contract requirements of the solution as applicable to Arbitrum. Ask Jordan (Aragon)? -->

## Methodologies<a name="methodologies"></a>

<!-- If the organization or workplace is unionized, then the union must be involved in designing and establishing the DAO -->



## Feasibility<a name="feasibility"></a>

<!-- Discuss HR and employment standards -->

<!-- Discuss identified problems and problem statements -->

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

Organizations and workplaces operating DAOs may benefit from increased employee engagement, as well as improved ability to respond to customer needs.
