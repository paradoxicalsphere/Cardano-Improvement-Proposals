## Executive Summary<a name="summary"></a>

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have been heralded as the future of governance, unlocking a more egalitarian approach to decision making. Historically, DAOs rely on token-weighted governance, in which users with the most tokens have the biggest share of voting power. Unfortunately, token-weighted governance models can inadvertently end up handing over control to a few "wealthy" participants, stripping influence away from the many.

The current proposal offers a solution approach for implementing a DAO within an existing organization or workplace, leveraging the structures and strengths already established to ensure that the DAO remains incorruptible over time. The proposal aims to describe the required solution components, such as new processes and software applications, as well as methodologies to deliver the components successfully.

## Inputs and Outputs<a name="io"></a>

Determining the solution approach relies on the following inputs:

- Business need
- Organizational process assets
- Required capabilities

Use the solution approach to define the solution scope.
