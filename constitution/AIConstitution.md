# Constitution of the Cardano Blockchain (by [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/))

<blockquote>
  <p>After more than two years of planning, preparation and development to implement a governance framework in the <a href="https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/">Voltaire</a> era, currently <a href="https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano/cardano-governance/cardano-constitution/draft-cardano-constitution/drafting-the-constitution-constitutional-workshops">Intersect</a>, in close collaboration with members and steered by the Cardano Civics Committee, is supporting and facilitating numerous in-person Constitutional Workshops held in cities around the world from August to October this year. The workshops are designed with two objectives in mind:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Gather broad and diverse community input on the <a href="https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano/cardano-governance/cardano-constitution/draft-cardano-constitution">Draft Constitution</a>.</li>
    <li>Select Constitutional Delegates to attend the <a href="https://www.emurgo.io/press-news/what-to-know-about-the-cardano-constitutional-convention-intersect/">Constitutional Convention</a> in Buenos Aires in December 2024 to complete and present to the community a draft of the Constitution for review and ratification in a network-wide vote to be scheduled early in 2025.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In response to the suggestion in the Draft Constitution that some Delegated Representatives (DReps) may be script-based as part of minimum viable governance, I messaged ChatGPT to <code>write a constitution for the cardano blockchain</code> returning the following results.</p>
