# Constitution of the Cardano Blockchain (by [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/))

<blockquote>
  <p>After more than two years of planning, preparation and development to implement a governance framework in the <a href="https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/">Voltaire</a> era, currently <a href="https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano/cardano-governance/cardano-constitution/draft-cardano-constitution/drafting-the-constitution-constitutional-workshops">Intersect</a>, in close collaboration with members and steered by the Cardano Civics Committee, is supporting and facilitating approximately 75 in-person <a href="https://lu.ma/constitution">Constitutional Workshops</a> held in cities around the world for about three months from August to October this year. The workshops are designed with two objectives in mind:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Gather broad and diverse community input on the <a href="./PDFs/240729-DraftConstitution.pdf">Draft Constitution</a>.</li>
    <li>Select Constitutional Delegates to attend the <a href="https://www.emurgo.io/press-news/what-to-know-about-the-cardano-constitutional-convention-intersect/">Constitutional Convention</a> in Buenos Aires, Argentina in December 2024 to complete and present to the community a draft of the Constitution for review and ratification in a network-wide vote to be scheduled early in 2025.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In response to the suggestion in the current Draft Constitution that some Delegated Representatives (DReps) may be script-based as part of minimum viable governance, today I messaged the ChatGPT artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot to <code>write a constitution for the cardano blockchain</code>, yielding the following results.</p>

  <p>There seems some irony in the observation that the draft prepared by human beings seeks to incorporate an element of desiring to use bots or algorithms in Cardano governance, whereas simply following the logic and asking a chatbot to prepare a constitution returns a constitution addressed only to human beings and reflecting human values. While some may interpret the observation as a reason to continue including support for bots in the Draft Constitution that has been a work in progress for such a long time without concern for unintended consequences, others may conclude that consequently the idea of implementing script-based DReps should be removed from the human draft, to support the governance process fully (or, perhaps to pay attention to the processing of the chatbot).
    
  <p>What do you think?</p>
