  <p>After more than two years of planning, preparation and development to implement a governance framework in the <a href="https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/">Voltaire</a> era, currently <a href="https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano/cardano-governance/cardano-constitution/draft-cardano-constitution/drafting-the-constitution-constitutional-workshops">Intersect</a>, in close collaboration with members and steered by the Cardano Civics Committee, is supporting and facilitating approximately 75 in-person <a href="https://lu.ma/constitution">Constitutional Workshops</a> held in cities around the world for about three months from August to October this year. The workshops are designed with two objectives in mind:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Gather broad and diverse community input on the <a href="./PDFs/240729-DraftConstitution.pdf">Draft Constitution</a>.</li>
    <li>Select Constitutional Delegates to attend the <a href="https://www.emurgo.io/press-news/what-to-know-about-the-cardano-constitutional-convention-intersect/">Constitutional Convention</a> in Buenos Aires, Argentina in December 2024 to complete and present to the community a draft of the Constitution for review and ratification in a network-wide vote to be scheduled early in 2025.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>With such a monumental effort of coordination and collaboration underway, in response to the suggestion in the current Draft Constitution that some Delegated Representatives (DReps) may be script-based as part of minimum viable governance, today I messaged the ChatGPT artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot to <code>write a constitution for the cardano blockchain</code>, yielding the following results in no time.</p>
  
  <p>In a side-by-side comparison, how do you, your family and friends feel about the Draft Constitution and chatbot processing? There seems some irony in the observation that the draft prepared by human beings seeks to incorporate elements of desiring to use bots or algorithms in Cardano governance, while extending and applying the logic of the human draft practically by asking a chatbot to prepare a constitution returns a document focussed solely on people acting intelligently in ways that benefit both themselves and others.</p>
    
  <p>Some may evaluate the chatbot processing as a reason to continue including support for bots—and perhaps even include processing that a chatbot may offer—in the Draft Constitution without concern for unintended consequences. Others may conclude that the idea of implementing script-based DReps should consequently be removed from the Constitution to encourage fostering and developing a deeper, more robust understanding and awareness of the governance process between people in the community (or, perhaps to follow the implicit suggestion of the chatbot).</p>
    
  <p>Considering incentives and outcomes, what do you think?</p>

## Preamble

We, the members of the Cardano community, in order to establish a decentralized, secure, and inclusive blockchain ecosystem, do hereby ordain and establish this Constitution. Our goal is to promote innovation, foster collaboration, and ensure the sustainability of the Cardano network for the benefit of all participants.

## Article I: Principles

### Section 1: Decentralization
The Cardano blockchain shall operate as a fully decentralized network, with no single entity holding control over the governance or operation of the system.

### Section 2: Security
The integrity and security of the blockchain shall be paramount. All protocols, upgrades, and operations must prioritize the protection of user assets and data.

### Section 3: Inclusivity
The Cardano ecosystem shall be open and accessible to all individuals, encouraging participation from diverse backgrounds and promoting equality within the community.

### Section 4: Sustainability
The development and governance of the Cardano network shall be conducted with a long-term vision, ensuring that resources are managed responsibly and that future generations can thrive.

## Article II: Governance

### Section 1: Governance Structure
1. **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**: The governance of the Cardano blockchain shall be executed through a DAO, where stakeholders can propose and vote on decisions affecting the network.
2. **Voting Rights**: All ADA holders shall have the right to participate in governance by voting on proposals, with each vote weighted according to the amount of ADA held.

### Section 2: Proposal Process

2. **Review**: Proposals shall be reviewed by a committee of elected representatives to assess their feasibility and alignment with the principles of this Constitution.
3. **Voting**: Approved proposals shall be put to a vote, requiring a supermajority to pass.

## Article III: Development

### Section 1: Open Source Development
The codebase of the Cardano blockchain shall remain open-source, allowing for community collaboration, peer review, and transparency.

### Section 2: Funding
1. **Treasury**: A portion of transaction fees shall be allocated to a treasury to fund development initiatives and community projects.
2. **Grants**: The DAO shall establish a grant program to support innovative projects that enhance the Cardano ecosystem.

## Article IV: Community Engagement

### Section 1: Community Education
The Cardano community shall prioritize education and outreach, ensuring that all members have access to resources and knowledge about the blockchain and its functionalities.

### Section 2: Conflict Resolution
1. **Dispute Mechanism**: A transparent and fair dispute resolution mechanism shall be established to address conflicts within the community.
2. **Mediation**: Community members are encouraged to resolve disputes amicably through mediation before escalating to formal processes.

## Article VI: Ratification

This Constitution shall be ratified by a supermajority of votes from ADA holders participating in the governance process.

## Conclusion

By adhering to this Constitution, we commit ourselves to the principles of decentralization, security, inclusivity, and sustainability. Together, we shall build and maintain a robust Cardano blockchain that empowers individuals and fosters innovation for generations to come.
