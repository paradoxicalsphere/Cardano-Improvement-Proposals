## Abstract

Are you interested in the potential for open-minded, inclusive, progressive and compassionate governance for Cardano? The Cardano protocol is a means to economy—not an end—and is not perfect. With proper governance, the protocol may not require perfection. The supply of stake pools far exceeds the demand from delegators. Increasing demand to meet the supply grows the economy. The current draft CIP aims to improve governance of the stake pool operator (SPO) community with the help of Input Output (IO), Cardano Foundation (CF) and EMURGO employees with the support of their employers as well as the Cardano community.

## Motivation

Imagining a better world without Cardano is possible. Building a better world with the help of Cardano may be preferable. Changing the world without people changing is impossible. Trustless systems are meant to build trust.

Central in the design of the Cardano protocol is [mathematical game theory](https://cardano.org/ouroboros/). In [mathematical game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), the [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) is a standard analyzed example.

As William Poundstone describes in the book [_Prisoner's Dilemma_](https://www.worldcat.org/title/23383657), two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is held in solitary confinement with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The police admit that they do not have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They plan to sentence both to a year in prison on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the police offer each prisoner a self-defeating bargain. The possible outcomes are:

- If Prisoner A and Prisoner B both defect—that is, betray each other—then each prisoner serves two years in prison.
- If Prisoner A betrays Prisoner B and Prisoner B remains silent, then Prisoner A will be set free and Prisoner B will serve three years in prison.
- If Prisoner A remains silent and Prisoner B betrays Prisoner A, then Prisoner A will serve three years in prison and Prisoner B will be set free.
- If Prisoner A and Prisoner B both do **not** defect—that is, Prisoner A and Prisoner B both do **not** betray the other—and both remain silent, then both prisoners will serve one year in prison (on the lesser charge).

Communication between the Cardano stake pool operator community and employees of Input Output, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO is limited. Also, IO, CF, EMURGO and the SPO community share a common interest in achieving Cardano's success.

Reflecting the Prisoner's Dilemma, where the SPO community may be represented as Prisoner A and employees may be represented as Prisoner B, or vice versa, the current CIP aims to achieve an outcome based on trust, mutual benefit, cooperation and coordination for each "prisoner" as well as in the relationship between "prisoners," rather than an outcome based on self interest and betrayal.

Often, discussion of the Prisoner's Dilemma seems to focus on logic, overlooking how an outcome of a dilemma may affect the world view and relationships for involved "prisoners" long after the outcome, with ongoing potential for entrenching and escalating patterns of betrayal—or **increasing trust**—over time.

## Specification

The current draft CIP offers a proposal emerging from the **Cardano community** in the form of a process change empowering Input Output, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO employees with discretionary (t)ADA to delegate to stake pools in the Production (Mainnet) environment as well as any and all testing environments.<sup><a href="#tada">1</a></sup> In other words, the process change would make (t)ADA available to each IO, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO employee for delegation to one or more stake pools based on the judgement of the individual employee. The process change aims to increase decentralization, transparency and agility of delegations to stake pools and related decisions that IO, the Cardano Foundation and EMURGO may make.

To find a balance that may help vitalize employees as well as the SPO and wider Cardano communities without introducing risks to the security of Cardano networks or any other potential forms of instability, **analysis, planning, elicitation, management and communication are needed from Input Output, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO to gain knowledge in support of the proposed initiative for implementation internally within the respective organizations in order to complete a proposal capable of garnering sufficient community understanding and consensus** so that the status of the current CIP may change toward Active.

For example, questions such as the following must be addressed:

- How much (t)ADA in total may be available for such an initiative?
- What may be the source(s) of (t)ADA available for such an initiative?
- Within such an initiative, what may be the limits of delegation for an employee?
- What requirements may include or exclude employees from delegating?
- How may rewards that delegations may receive be managed? By whom?
- How may existing or new workplace contracts, agreements, guidelines, codes of conduct or practices between employer and employee apply to such an initiative?
- What record keeping or know your customer (KYC) requirements may apply to such an initiative?
- How long must any records be kept?
- Who may access records kept in support of such an initiative?
- How is privacy protected?
- When required, how may records be securely destroyed?
- How may the potential or need for changes or adjustments to the operational guidelines for such an initiative be managed?
- Would such an initiative affect existing delegation strategies that Input Output, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO currently may practice, and if so, how?

<a name="tada"></a><sup>1</sup> Whereas ADA is the digital currency of the Cardano Production (Mainnet) environment, tADA is the digital currency of testing environments. The current document refers to Cardano digital currencies collectively as (t)ADA. 

## Rationale

The following primary stakeholders are identified:

- The Cardano stake pool operator community
- Input Output
- IO employees
- The Cardano Foundation
- Cardano Foundation employees
- EMURGO
- EMURGO employees

With further stakeholder engagement and research, over the longer term perhaps the current proposal may support the creation of a form of [decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)](https://www.fttdao.com/blog/what-is-dao/) for Input Output, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO employees to help with governance of the SPO community.
