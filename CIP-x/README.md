## Abstract

Are you interested in more diverse, inclusive, progressive and compassionate governance for Cardano, as well as greater accountability for your investment in the ecosystem? The Cardano protocol is a means to economy—not an end—and is not perfect. With proper governance, the protocol may not require perfection.

</p>

Currently, the supply of stake pools exceeds the demand from delegators. Creating increased demand to meet the supply produces a net effect of growing the Cardano economy. The current draft CIP aims to improve and enhance governance of the stake pool operator (SPO) community with the help of Input Output (IO), Cardano Foundation (CF) and EMURGO employees including the support of their employers as well as the Cardano community.

The current CIP is drafted with consideration of the potential for submission as a governance action using the pending framework of [CIP-1694](https://github.com/JaredCorduan/CIPs/tree/voltaire-v1/CIP-1694).

## Motivation

Imagining a better world without Cardano is possible. Building a better world with the help of Cardano may be preferable. In 1977, Hubert Humphrey, who served as US Vice President from 1965 to 1969, said, "The moral test of government is how that government treats those who are \[most vulnerable\]."<!-- https://atkinsbookshelf.wordpress.com/2018/02/21/famous-misquotations-a-civilization-is-measured-by-how-it-treats-its-weakest-members/ --> Changing the world without people changing is impossible. Trustless systems are meant to build trust.

Central in the design of the Cardano protocol is [mathematical game theory](https://cardano.org/ouroboros/). In [mathematical game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), the [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) is a standard analyzed example.

As William Poundstone describes in the book [_Prisoner's Dilemma_](https://www.worldcat.org/title/23383657), two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is held in solitary confinement with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The police admit that they do not have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They plan to sentence both to a year in prison on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the police offer each prisoner a self-defeating bargain. The possible outcomes are:

- If Prisoner A and Prisoner B both defect—that is, betray each other—then each prisoner serves two years in prison.
- If Prisoner A betrays Prisoner B and Prisoner B remains silent, then Prisoner A will be set free and Prisoner B will serve three years in prison.
- If Prisoner A remains silent and Prisoner B betrays Prisoner A, then Prisoner A will serve three years in prison and Prisoner B will be set free.
- If Prisoner A and Prisoner B both do **not** defect—that is, Prisoner A and Prisoner B both do **not** betray each other—and both remain silent, then both prisoners will serve one year in prison (on the lesser charge).

Communication between the Cardano stake pool operator community and employees of Input Output, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO is limited. Also, IO, CF, EMURGO and the SPO community share a common interest in achieving Cardano's success.

Based on the Prisoner's Dilemma, where the SPO community may be represented as Prisoner A and employees may be represented as Prisoner B, or vice versa, the current CIP aims to achieve an outcome based on trust, mutual benefit, cooperation and coordination for each "prisoner" as well as in the relationship between "prisoners," rather than an outcome based on self interest and betrayal.

Often, discussion of the Prisoner's Dilemma seems to focus on logic, overlooking how an outcome of a dilemma may affect the world view and relationships for involved "prisoners" long after the outcome, with ongoing potential for entrenching and escalating patterns of betrayal—or for building trust—over time.

## Specification

The current draft CIP offers a proposal emerging from the Cardano community in the form of a process change empowering Input Output, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO employees with discretionary (t)ADA to delegate to stake pools in the Production (Mainnet) environment as well as any and all testing environments.<sup><a href="#tada">1</a></sup> In other words, the process change would make (t)ADA available to each IO, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO employee for delegation to one or more stake pools based on the judgement of the individual employee. <b>The process change aims to increase decentralization, transparency and agility of delegations to stake pools and related decisions that IO, the Cardano Foundation and EMURGO may make.</b>

To find a balance that may help vitalize employees as well as the SPO and wider Cardano communities without introducing risks to the security of Cardano networks or any other potential forms of instability, <b>analysis, planning, elicitation, management and communication are needed from Input Output, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO to gain knowledge in support of the proposed initiative for implementation internally within the respective organizations in order to complete a proposal capable of garnering sufficient community understanding and consensus so that the status of the current CIP may change toward Active</b>.

For example, questions such as the following must be addressed:

- How much (t)ADA in total may be available for such an initiative?
- What may be the source(s) of (t)ADA available for such an initiative?
- Within such an initiative, what may be the limits of delegation for an employee?
- What requirements may include or exclude employees from delegating?
- How may rewards that delegations may receive be managed? By whom?
- How may existing or new workplace contracts, agreements, guidelines, codes of conduct or practices between employer and employee apply to such an initiative?
- What record keeping or know your customer (KYC) requirements may apply to such an initiative?
- How long must any records be kept?
- Who may access records kept in support of such an initiative?
- How is privacy protected?
- When required, how may records be securely destroyed?
- How may the potential or need for changes or adjustments to the operational guidelines for such an initiative be managed?
- What aspects of such an initiative may be administered using smart contracts?
- Would such an initiative affect existing delegation strategies that Input Output, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO currently may practice, and if so, how?

<a name="tada"></a><sup>1</sup> Whereas ADA is the digital currency of the Cardano Production (Mainnet) environment, tADA is the digital currency of testing environments. The current document refers to Cardano digital currencies collectively as (t)ADA. 

## Rationale

The following primary stakeholders are identified:

- The Cardano community
- Input Output
- Input Output employees
- The Cardano Foundation
- Cardano Foundation employees
- EMURGO
- EMURGO employees

With further stakeholder engagement and research, over the longer term perhaps the current proposal may support the creation of a form of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for Input Output, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO employees to help with governance of the SPO community.

Sasha Ivanov, a theoretical physicist by background, founded the [Waves](https://waves.tech/) blockchain platform in 2016. In the article [DAOs Will Never Work Without Fixing Governance](https://cointelegraph.com/news/daos-will-never-work-without-fixing-governance) published in September 2022, Ivanov identifies the following primary risk associated with DAOs in practice:

<b>Token-weighted governance, in which users with the most tokens have the biggest share of voting power, can inadvertently end up handing over control to a few wealthy participants and stripping it away from the many.</b>

To mitigate the aforementioned risk, the current CIP proposes that—in an initiative to allocate an amount of (t)ADA to employees solely for the purpose of potential delegation to one or more stake pools based on the judgement of the individual employee—Input Output, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO as employers regulate weighted voting and tokenomics, establishing constraints at the management level to maintain a balance of voting power. Employee roles and responsibilities include the potential to delegate (t)ADA based on the terms and conditions of employment. In workplaces, managing roles and responsibilities while empowering employees to complete their day-to-day activities and duties successfully is a fundamental existing requirement.

In his article, Ivanov also identifies the following opportunities. The list also explains how the current CIP aims to realize each opportunity:

* <b>DAOs have been heralded as the future of governance, unlocking a more egalitarian approach to decision making</b>—The current CIP proposes an approach for further decentralizing existing decision-making processes within Input Output, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO organizations related to stake pool delegations.
* <b>A voting structure based on meritocracy may be just what is needed</b>—[Meritocracy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/merit#h1) is "a system, organization or society in which people are chosen and moved into positions of success, power and influence on the basis of their demonstrated abilities and merit." Within the framework of a workplace, rewarding successes in achieving goals set for performance is a form of motivation. In relation to the current CIP, Input Output, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO may seek to reward employee contributions meeting or exceeding expectations with increased benefits and responsibilities related to allocation of discretionary (t)ADA solely for delegation to stake pools, for example.
* <b>Imagine a new model, one where voting members are assessed against certain key performance indicators (KPIs) [involving] engagement and development metrics within the DAO<!--... a failure to meet these KPIs can result in that user’s voting power being reduced or removed entirely--></b>—[KPIs](https://www.qlik.com/us/kpi) are "quantifiable measures of performance over time for a specific objective [providing] targets for [individuals and] teams [within organizations] to aim for; milestones to gauge progress; and, insights that help people across the organization make better decisions... [KPIs] help every area of the business move forward at the strategic level." Within organizations and workplaces, KPIs are already commonly in use. Existing organizational structures within Input Output, Cardano Foundation and EMURGO may provide a foundation well suited for implementing KPIs designed to enable and support the continuing operation of a stable DAO. As Ivanov points out, assessing employees against certain KPIs potentially encourages all entities to make decisions that are in the broader interest of the community, not just themselves.

As explained in the article [Entering Voltaire: Poll Experiment Live on Mainnet](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/entering-voltaire-poll-experiment-live-on-mainnet/), the on-chain polling mechanism implemented via [CIP-0094](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0094) introduces an elegant mechanism to hear the voices of (t)ADA holders: "After the [poll or survey] question gets published, SPOs will have until the end of the next epoch to vote. A period of two additional epochs will then give stake delegators the time to consult the dashboards, see how SPOs voted, examine the results, and decide whether or not to redelegate their stake to another SPO." The current CIP may introduce an opportunity for employees to participate in the delegation or redelegation phase of on-chain polls or surveys using discretionary (t)ADA.

## Backwards Compatibility

To be determined

## Path to Active

The current CIP introduces a requirement for a new type of [wallet address key pair](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/cardano-key-pairs/#wallet-address-key-pairs).<sup><a href="#wallet">2</a></sup> Wallet addresses assigned the new type are included in a closed set of wallet addresses, all having the same type. Support for multiple closed sets is required. Wallet addresses included in a closed set belong to exactly one closed set, and no more. For employees, (t)ADA in a wallet address included in a closed set may only be sent to wallet addresses also included in the same closed set. Wallet addresses belonging to a closed set maintain the existing functionality to delegate the wallet to a pool using a staking address.

For the employer to administer the new type of wallet address, the current CIP also requires implementation of mechanisms to:
* Create closed sets
* Add wallet addresses to—or remove wallet addresses from—closed sets
* Set strictly-enforced permissions for closed sets in terms of the other closed sets—or one or more specific wallet addresses that do NOT belonging to any closed set—allowed to send (t)ADA <b>to</b> wallet addresses in a closed set
* Send (t)ADA safely and securely <b>from</b> wallet addresses included in a closed set to one or more wallet addresses NOT belonging to any closed set without compromising the integrity of the closed set of wallet addresses—or (t)ADA balances of wallet addresses in the closed set—for the employee end user

Smart contracts that may be implemented in relation to the current CIP enforce the definitions and permissions of closed sets.

To implement the current CIP, each employee is assigned a unique closed set of wallet addresses. Closed sets, as well as the public verification key files for payment and stake addresses of wallet addresses belonging to each closed set, may be shared publicly.<sup><a href="#private">3</a></sup> The private signing key files for a wallet address belonging to a closed set is accessible only to the employee assigned the wallet address and to the employer.<sup><a href="#secret">4</a></sup>

<a name="wallet"></a><sup>2</sup> Each Cardano wallet address is comprised of a payment address and a staking address.

<a name="private"></a><sup>3</sup> The relationships between closed sets may be private.

<a name="secret"></a><sup>4</sup> The private signing key file gives access to monies in the wallet address.
